    <div class="menu-item">After my mission in Thailand, I took a job working for Shirley herself, as a baker's apprentice. I cannot express how grateful I am that she took me under her wing.</div>
    <div class="menu-item">I worked there for years, working my way up the ranks, until I was the number two in the whole business. The right hand man of Shirley herself. She was impressed by how fast I learned, and how easily baking came to me.</div>  
    <div class="menu-item">When I was married last year, my wife helped me see that I had outgrown Shirley- there was nothing else she could teach me, since I had become her better. As such, I set out to create my own bakery. After finding some investors, we opened across the street from the place I learned to bake. After months of fierce competition, Shirley was forced out of business and I bought a brand new Tesla. There was a new king in town-- Me!</div>
